I2C interface:
  I2C Addr: 0x31

  Requests from on high:
    0-6: Set Report to send.  5 has a_pin (1 byte), 6 has EEPROM addr (1 byte),
         the rest have no data.
    8<a_pin><num_pots>: Set num_pots for a_pin (1 byte each)
    9<EEPROM_addr><byte>: Store <byte> at <EEPROM_addr>
    10: Calibate low
    11: Calibate center
    12: Calibate high
    13: Write_calibations

  Reports to on high:
    0: Errno, Err_data, pot.value (1 byte each) for each pot (2 + num_pots bytes total)
    1: num_pots, NUM_A_PINS, EEPROM_AVAIL EEPROM_USED (4 bytes total)
    2: Errno, Err_data (2 bytes total)
    3: Num_pots for each a_pin (NUM_A_PINS bytes total)
    4: Cycle_time (uSec, 4 bytes total)
    5. cal_low, cal_center, cal_high for each pot in a_pin (6 * num_pots for a_pin)
    6. next stored EEPROM byte (1 byte, EEPROM addr auto increments)
