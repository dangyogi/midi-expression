scan_switches (in switches.ino) calls:
  switch_open (in events.ino) calls:
    run_event(Switch_opened_event[sw], sw) -- in events.ino
  switch_closed (in events.ino) calls:
    run_event(Switch_closed_event[sw], sw) -- in events.ino

Encoders use the following events on sw_A/B:
  ENC_A/B_CLOSED
  ENC_A/B_OPENED

  These both call inc_encoder (in events.ino), which calls encoder_changed (in events.ino), which:
    calls run_event(Encoder[enc].var->var_type->display_value, enc) in events.ino to update the display
    and then run_event(Encoder[enc].encoder_event, enc) to process the change.

Triggers use the following events:
  -- on the sw/bt:
       TRIGGER_SW_ON/OFF            -- turns trigger.continuous and led on/off
       TRIGGER_BT_PRESSED/RELEASED  -- turns led on/off and calls check_trigger,
                                       which runs the trigger's check_event.
  -- for check_event:
       CHECK_POTS                   -- calls pot_changed for each new pot value.
       CHECK_FUNCTIONS              -- calls fun_changed if any function value has changed.
