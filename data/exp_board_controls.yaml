    code:

                send_closed
            state = 0

            state += 1
            if state >= threshold:
                send_open

        for 2 I2C devices, threshold ~42 to give 5mSec delay
        for 9 GPIO devices, threshold ~560 to give 5mSec delay

        state < threshold counts as closed
        state >= threshold counts as open
