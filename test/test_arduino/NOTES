Functions exposed for testing have two stubs generated:

  - a stub representing the function being exposed.  This function will be called rather than the
    actual function.  It is called a "called_stub".
      
      1. This stub sends a "fun called" request to the test driver with the parameter values.
      2. The stub then processes all test driver requests (if any) up to the "return" request.
         - The test driver validates the parameter values.
         - The test driver may issue requests for global values to validate them.
         - The test driver may issue requests to change global values.
         - The test driver may use this opportunity to issue "call" requests to other functions to test
           them out before returning.
         - The test driver may print messages to its stdout/stderr.
         - The test driver may, or may not, send a "call" request to call the actual function (if there
           is one).
         - Finally, the test driver issues a "return" request.
      3. The stub returns the value in the "return" request.

  - a stub to call the real function and return the results.  This is the function actually called when
    the test driver issues a "call" request.  This is called a "caller_stub".

      1. This stub translates the received parameter values (ascii to byte, int, long, bool, etc).
      2. The stub then calls the real function (which has had it's name modified so as not to conflict
         with the first stub above).
      3. The stub issues a "returned" request back to the test driver.


C++ Requests

    The C++ program connects to the test driver program and then may issue the following requests:

    - "test_dir" dir
      - issued at program startup
      - no response expected
    - "#define" name
      - issued at program startup
      - no response expected
    - "global" name addr len type
      - issued at program startup
      - no response expected
    - "array" name addr array_len(bytes) element_len element_type: dimensions
      - issued at program startup
      - no response expected
    - "sub_classes" name sub_classes
      - issued at program startup
      - no response expected
    - "field" struct_name field_name offset field_len field_type
      - issued at program startup
      - no response expected
    - "function" name expects_return param_names
      - issued at program startup
      - no response expected
    - "ready"
      - issued once at program startup, after all above messages have been sent out
      - no response expected
      - indicates the C++ program is now ready to process test driver requests.
    - "fun_called" name params
      - Issued by first type of stub, above.
      - C++ program now accepts any test driver requests, until "return" request received.
      - return value returned from stub
    - "returned" [value]
      - issued in response to "call" test driver request.


Test Driver Requests

    The test driver may issue the following requests:

    - "display" text
      - the entire command line is displayed on stdout.
      - no result is returned to the test_driver.
    - "get_global" type addr offsets
      - expects get_global final_addr value
      - each offset follows a pointer, addrs prior to all offsets are dereferenced in C++ program
      - type is: s[1,2,4], u[1,2,4], f[4,8], str (null terminated), <int> (len of data)
    - "set_global" type addr offsets = value
      - expects set_global final_addr previous_value
      - type, addr and offsets work as in "get_global" request.
    - "call" name arguments
      - Arguments are separated by a space.  The elements in a single array argument are passed as a
        hex data stream of the length of the array.
      - This calls the second type of stub, above within the C++ program.  If there are no arguments,
        it passes 0 as args (rather than a pointer to '\0').
      - Test driver now responds to C++ "fun called" requests until "returned" request received.
      - Test driver validates the returned value.
      - Test driver issues whatever other requests it wants to do (e.g., "get global" to validate
        global variables have been set correctly).
    - "return" [value]
      - issued in response to "fun called" C++ request.
    - "exit" exit_status
      - causes the C++ program to immediately terminate.
      - This will break the socket connection to the test driver, which will loop back to accept the
        next connection and start over again.

Test Scripts:

    Responses = {(function_name, test_name, seq_number): [Response]}

    Each response has the following methods:
        - select: determine whether it is applicable (e.g., based on combinations of params)
        - run: to respond to the function being called.

    The selection process runs the following steps until a response answer True to its select method:
        - Examine each response in (function_name, test_name, seq_number) list.
        - Examine each response in (function_name, test_name) list.
        - Examine each response in function_name list.
        - If all of these fail, report an error.

    When the response is run it can:
        - expression
          - number
          - name (could be param name, "as" names, or defined name)
        - verify
          - "vrange exp low high"
          - "vin exp valid_values"
        - get global
          - "global as name accessors"
        - set globals
          - "store prev value name accessors"
        - call function(s) (with possibly different params)
          - "call as name params"
        - verify function results (use "as" in call as exp in verify)
        - verify globals (use "as" in get global as exp in verify)
        - set globals
        - display messages
          - "display message-with-{}s"
        - return function results
          - "return result"
        - error (function shouldn't be called)

Interactive commands:

    - ? command
      shows translated command
    - trace on|off
    - readline
      readline from Sock and display it
    - run script
    - get global_name dims fields (subclass name required after class fields)
      - result: get_global final_addr value
    - set global_name dims fields = value
      - dims and fields work like get
      - result: set_global final_addr prev_value
    - <any test_driver request>
